### NS2497-report: HiFi Genomic Sequences (Generated 2022-02-12) ###
- Biological Sample ID: ACLU0235
- ICBR Sample ID: NS2497-ACLU0235-021022
- Tissue Type: Whole Body	
- Life Stage: 5th instar larva
- Fixative:	RNA Later (5000uL)
- Colony:	Georgia

### NS2778-report-Run01: IsoSeq RNA Sequences ###
_Note, all IsoSeq samples were multiplexed and barcoded. Sample IDs listed are for instars 1-5 respectively. Run01 had barcoding complications, yielding suffecient reads only for two samples (will confirm and add sample IDs later)_
- Biological Sample IDs: ACLU0243; ACLU0248; ACLU0102; ACLU0128; ACLU0232.
- ICBR Sample ID: NS2778-AKawahara-Isoseq-Cell1 (CCS) (all samples)
- Tissue Type: Silk Glands
- Life Stage: 1st-5th instar larvae
- Fixative:	RNA Later (100uL-5000uL)
- Colony:	North Carolina/Georgia	
- Species: _Actias	luna_	

### NS2778-report-Run02: IsoSeq RNA Sequences ###
_Note, all IsoSeq samples were multiplexed and barcoded. Sample IDs listed are for instars 1-5 respectively. Run 02 re-ran samples with barcoding complications, yielding suffecient reads for remaining 3 samples (will confirm and add sample IDs later)_
- Biological Sample IDs: ACLU0243; ACLU0248; ACLU0102; ACLU0128; ACLU0232.
- ICBR Sample ID: NS2778-BCP5-Repeat-Cell1 (CCS) (all samples)
- Tissue Type: Silk Glands
- Life Stage: 1st-5th instar larvae
- Fixative:	RNA Later (100uL-5000uL)
- Colony:	North Carolina/Georgia	
- Species: _Actias	luna_
